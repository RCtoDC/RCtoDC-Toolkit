## **Introduction**

The 3D and XR Toolkit for Cultural Heritage is a core component of the RCtoDC project, **designed to support cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) in their digitization efforts**. This toolkit will serve as a comprehensive and user-friendly resource, providing step-by-step guidance on digitization workflows, equipment usage, metadata integration, and best practices. The primary goal is to facilitate efficient and high-quality digital preservation, ensuring that CHIs can contribute structured, reusable, and standardized digital assets to the European Data Space for Cultural Heritage.

With the rapid advancement of 3D scanning, photogrammetry, LiDAR, and XR technologies, there is a growing need for accessible and practical tools **that help CHIs navigate the complex technical landscape of digitization**. This toolkit is specifically designed to bridge the gap between technical requirements and practical implementation, offering modular resources that cater to institutions with different levels of expertise and technological capacity.

The initial concept of the toolkit is structured **into multiple key modules**, each addressing a specific aspect of digitization and data integration. These include frameworks for digitization planning, equipment guides, templates for metadata standardization, training materials, and case studies from real-world applications. By leveraging these resources, CHIs will be empowered to execute high-quality 3D and XR digitization projects, ensuring the sustainability and accessibility of their digital collections.

Project summary

_Grant Preparation (General Information screen) - Provide an overall description of your project (including context and overall objectives, planned activities and main achievements, and expected results and impacts (on target groups, change procedures, capacities, innovation etc)). This summary should give readers a clear idea of what your project is about. Use the project summary from your proposal_

The project will digitize cultural heritage artefacts and make them available to the public through the use of 3D and XR technologies by creating two new collections on Europeana, one of baroque sculptures by Francesco Robba and one of baroque objects from Croatia and Slovenia. Usage of CultArm3D FT10 range Modular 3D Digitization System, will be used to scan the artifacts and ensure highest quality. It will create a user-friendly app -Toolkit for 3D and XR digitization, and offer online and on-site trainings about importance and use of technologies for digitization. The project will also create AR experiences for the public based on the 3D scans.

The project consists of four distinctive WPs executed within 18 months that involve cross-border cooperation of Croatian, Slovenian and Austrian project partners.

General objectives are:

1. Digitize cultural heritage artefacts at risk and make them available to the public through the use of 3D and XR technologies

2. Create a Toolkit for 3D and XR digitization

3. Offer online and on-site trainings for CHIs and other stakeholders

4. Two new collections on Europeana, one of baroque sculptures by Francesco Robba and one of baroque objects from Croatia and Slovenia

5. Equalizing digitization across Europe

Specific objectives are:

1. Digitize 30 objects at risk from southeastern Europe by Francesco Robba and other baroque sculptors

2. Create AR experiences for 30 3D-scanned objects

3. Create training materials and an app for learning about 3D and XR digitization

4. Upload the digitized objects to Europeana and collaborate with other relevant organizations

5. Reduce the physical impact and carbon footprint of cultural heritage preservation

The project contributes to the Digital Europe Program by advancing the digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions and indirectly contributes to the European Green Deal by reducing physical impact and carbon footprint.
